# butter-sketch-plugin

Butter will butt your layers together.

The plugin fills the gap between the "Align" tool and the "Distribute" tool. Instead of aligning to a single axis or distributing the objects evenly, I wanted to butt objects together, removing any whitespace or overlaps between them.

**New V2** Spacing options have been added!
